# YourBookExperience

YourBookExperience is a mobile application developed to allow users to create, edit, browse and rate reviews about their and other user's experience reading a book.
It has two parts: the backend, which works based on a local database that caches information for the specific device and a server situated on the local network hosting a database, and a frontend, which is implemented in two ways: native, with Kotlin and non-native, with Flutter.
